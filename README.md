# CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This repo contains the solutions to the projects of the 2018 summer session of Berkeley's **CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**. 

# Project Descriptions and Instructions

In the table below, you will find a short description of all the projects included in this repo. Each project has a link that takes you to that specific project's instructions. The links provided are not for the Summer 2018 version of the course since the links for that course are not available, however the instructions for Fall 2018 version of the course are the same for all projects. 

In order to run projects 1-4, you will need **Python 2.7.x**  .

| Project name               |Topic                          |Link to Project Instructions                         
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------
|P1 - Search|`Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.`            |[Instructions for Project 1](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project2.html)  			
|P2 - Multi-Agent Search          |`Students will apply the search algorithms and problems implemented in Project 1 to handle more difficult scenarios that include controlling multiple pacman agents and planning under time constraints"`|[Instructions for Project 2](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project2.html)|
P3 - Reinforcement Learning           |`Students implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.`|[Instructions for Project 3](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project3.html)|
P4 - GhostBusters           |`Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Students implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.`|[Instructions for Project 4](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/project4.html)|
